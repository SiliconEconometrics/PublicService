<title>Results of running the program a million times on each contest in the NSW local government elections 2017</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
We ran our <a href="https://github.com/SiliconEconometrics/PublicService">program</a> a million times on each contest in the 2016 NSW local government elections.
The results are shown here in four tables:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="LocalGovernmentNSW2017_All.html">All contests</a></li>
  <li><a href="LocalGovernmentNSW2017_Stochastic.html">Only those contests that had different results (who or order) in at least one run</a></li>
  <li><a href="LocalGovernmentNSW2017_StochasticElected.html">Only those contests that had different results (who was elected) in at least one run</a></li>
  <li><a href="LocalGovernmentNSW2017_NotOfficial.html">Only those contests where the most likely outcome differed from the official results (who or order)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Each contest is shown with a table of the elected people, for each showing the proportion of the time they are
elected, the mean position that they were elected in amongst the times they were elected, and the official
position elected.
</p>

<p>
This is meant to give an idea of the level of randomness that the election counting algorithm produces. We are
not claiming that we understand the legislation properly (it is somewhat ambiguous), nor the NSWEC specification
(it is somewhat ambiguous), 
nor that our program is without errors. 
So our results may
not be correct. We do not warranty them in any way. 
You should avoid trusting programs when you can, including ours.
But on the bright side the results are somewhat neatly presented. 
Our program is <a href="https://github.com/SiliconEconometrics/PublicService">available</a> for you to look at, you can run it yourself, and, best of all, you can 
write your own program and check it against ours.
